## Additional Information
Since the bot does not use a command handler, it requires a lot of RAM to operate. Additionally, it is not connected to a database, and its functionality is limited to basic moderation features. As this is a personal project and is not actively maintained, it may not function as expected and may have security vulnerabilities or other issues. Use at your own risk.
