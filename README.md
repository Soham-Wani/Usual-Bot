# Usual-Bot-v1
Usual Bot is a basic Discord bot made using `Node.js` and `discord.js`. It was the my first bot, and while it lacks a command handler, it is fully functional and offers basic moderation features such as kick and ban, as well as a few API integrations.

## Disclaimer
Please note that the bot does not support slash commands, which are mandatory for verified bots on Discord. As such, please proceed with caution when using this bot.

## For Developers
I have left many comments in the main file of `index.js` so you can understand the code and preferably use it when in need.

## Additional Information 
As previously mentioned, the bot does not use a command handler, and as a result, it requires a lot of RAM to operate. Additionally, it is not connected to a database, and its functionality is limited to basic moderation features.

## Host
The bot was initially hosted on [Replit](https://replit.com). But it didn't take me time to switch to [Heroku](https://heroku.com) because resources ran out too quickly there. But to be honest, I wouldn't recommend the later either!
