# Usual-Bot
Usual Bot was a public Discord bot made using `discord.js`. This was my first bot, so it was very basic, without a command handler, yet fully functional. It is great for those who are starting and trying to understand Discord Bot development for the first time.

# Without a command handler?
Yes, the code doesn't have any command handler. The bot does basic moderation features like kick, ban, etc. and a few API integrations that I added later. The bot works without any handler. In return, it needs a lot of RAM.

## Does it have a database?
No. Being extremely basic, the bot is not connected to a database.

## Where was the bot hosted?
The bot was initially hosted on [Replit](https://replit.com). But it didn't take me time to switch to [Heroku](https://heroku.com) because resources ran out too quickly there.
