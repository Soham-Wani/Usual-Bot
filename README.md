# Usual-Bot
Usual Bot was a public `Node.js` Discord bot made using `discord.js`. This was my first bot, so it was very basic, without a command handler, yet fully functional. It is great for those who are starting and trying to understand Discord Bot development for the first time.

## For Developers
I have left many comments in the main file of `index.js` so you can understand the code and preferably use it when in need.

## Some More Info
Yes, the code doesn't have any command handler. The bot does basic moderation features like kick, ban, etc. and a few API integrations that I added later. The bot works without any handler. In return, it needs a lot of RAM. 

Also, being extremely basic, the bot is not connected to a database.

## Host
The bot was initially hosted on [Replit](https://replit.com). But it didn't take me time to switch to [Heroku](https://heroku.com) because resources ran out too quickly there. But to be honest, I wouldn't recommend the later!
